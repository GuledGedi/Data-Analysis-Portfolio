# Guled's Data Analysis Portfolio

Hello, and welcome to my GitHub. My name is Guled Gedi, and I am an upcoming data analyst with a Bachelor's in Neuroscience and a Minor in Statistics. I have recently completed my coursework for my Master's in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. To bolster my analytical experience, I completed the Google Advanced Data Analyst Certification which introduced me to more complex concepts in the analytical world such as machine learning and stack overflow. I am passionate about uncovering meaningful patterns in data and creating impactful visualizations. With my background in scientific research along with combining technical expertise in Python, SQL, and machine learning accompanied by strong interpersonal skills, I have been able to produce informative and easy-to-approach understandings from data. I have compiled my work on this site to showcase my skills and abilities.

# Projects

[**Video Game Sales**](https://github.com/GuledGedi/Video-Game-Sales): 

The project aims to understand the decline in popularity of handheld video game consoles by comparing sales data between handheld and home gaming systems over a 30-year period (1985-2015). Using SAS regression analysis on variables like global sales, platform type, critic scores, and marketing priority, the research attempted to identify patterns that could explain the handheld market's decline and potentially predict if home consoles might follow a similar trajectory.


[**COVID & Wellbeing**](https://github.com/GuledGedi/COVID-Well-Being-Dashboard-Tableau):

The project analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on global happiness and mental wellbeing using the World Happiness Report 2020 dataset, seeking to understand how the pandemic affected life satisfaction across different regions. Through data visualization techniques in Tableau, the researcher created a dashboard examining three key metrics: Regional Happiness (comparing happiness by world region), Social Comfort per Country (analyzing relationships between happiness, freedom, and social support), and Life Fulfillment (exploring connections between happiness, life expectancy, and generosity).
